# LinkedListFromScratch

With this you can:
- create a LinkedList 
- add N values to it, being any kind of data
- support to indexing 
- a toString method for sysouts
- reversing the linked list and any subsequent linked lists and arrays inside it

DONE:
- Random Data Generator
- Ordering

WIP:
- Refactory
- Test cases

TODO:
- More efficient reversing algorithm
- Data flow with a diagram
- Remove at index, or at the end or beginning of the list
- Expanding test cases to real-world scenarios
